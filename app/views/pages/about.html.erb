    This web application was created with

    from the <%= link_to('RailsApps project', 'http://railsapps.github.io/') %>.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    <b>Styling</b><br/> Completely custom with hints of boostrap.
    TODO: refractor inline css into scss
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Models</b><br/> Only Review and User. I excluded the Movie model because all the information is stored in "The Movie Database API".
    We could use the seed file to query for every movie and store the details in our own database.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Gems</b><br/>
    Tmdb (for movie details)<br/>
    Devise (for secure user login/signup)<br/>
    Rspec (for testing) <br/>
  </p>

    <b>Testing (Rspec)</b><br/>

    What does sort by title mean? Alphabetically?<br/>
    Should I load reviews from Tmdb or are they all custom?<br/>
    Do you have to be logged in to rate a movie? Otherwise how would you get their email?
    Wouldn't it make more sense for the review to list their username and not email?
